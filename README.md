🔗 Blockchain Security → Tickets can be securely transferred or resold.

📱 QR Check-in System → Seamless event entry using on-chain verification.

🤖 Sentiment-Based Recommendation Engine → Suggests events to users based on their past preferences and real-time social media hype.

🚀 Features

✅ Organizer Dashboard – Create events & mint NFT tickets.
✅ User Ticket Marketplace – Browse and purchase event tickets.
✅ Secure Ownership – Tickets stored in blockchain wallets (Pera, AlgoSigner).
✅ QR Code Verification – Event check-in using NFT ownership validation.
